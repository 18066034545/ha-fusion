### URL Parameters

These features only work when exposing a port in the configuration or using Docker. Note that query strings cannot be read when using Ingress.

#### View

To set a particular view when the page loads, add the "view" parameter. For example, if you have a "Bedroom" view, append the query string `?view=Bedroom` to the URL.

#### Menu

To disable the menu button, append the query string `?menu=false` to the URL. This is useful for wall-mounted tablets.
