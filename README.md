## Usage Guide

### Floor Plan Templates

ha-fusion provides multiple pre-set floor plan templates to help you quickly configure your smart home space:

1. **Two-bedroom Layout**
   - Suitable for small families
   - Includes basic rooms and functions
   - Basic smart control features

2. **Three-bedroom Layout**
   - Suitable for medium-sized families
   - Additional study room space
   - More complete smart control system

3. **Villa Layout**
   - Suitable for large homes
   - Includes media room, gym, and other functional spaces
   - Complete smart home solution

Each room comes with the following pre-set function areas:
- Lighting control
- Curtain control

### URL Parameters

These features are only effective when ports are exposed in configuration or when using Docker. Note: URL parameters cannot be read when using Ingress.

#### Views

To set a specific view on page load, add the "view" parameter. For example, if you have a "Bedroom" view, add the query string `?view=Bedroom` to the URL.

#### Menu

To disable the menu button, add the query string `?menu=false` to the URL. This is particularly useful for wall-mounted tablets.
